Check two one two. This is just a test.
My name is Matthew Richards. I am a Mechanical Engineer. 
My career goals are to run my own company and achieve financial independence. Guess that's not really a career goal but whatever. 
I chose Fintech as something to get into because it's got high potential with little downside.
